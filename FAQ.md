# Frequently Asked Questions

## Getting Started

### What is PrayerCircle?

PrayerCircle is a platform that connects people who need prayer with people who want to pray. Think of it as a safe space where you can share what's on your heart and know that real people will lift you up in prayer. Churches can join to support their congregations and connect with nearby communities.

### Do I need an account to use PrayerCircle?

You can browse prayers and see churches without an account, but you'll need to sign up to submit prayers, respond to requests, or join a church community. The good news? You can also submit prayers anonymously even without signing in.

### Is PrayerCircle really free?

Yes, completely free. We built this to serve the faith community, not to make money from it. There are no hidden fees, premium tiers, or paid features.

### How do I sign up?

Click "Sign In" in the top navigation, and you can create an account using your email, Google, GitHub, or other sign-in options. It takes less than a minute.

## Privacy & Safety

### Is my information safe?

Absolutely. We use industry-standard security measures to protect your information. All data is encrypted, and we never sell your information to anyone. Your prayers are treated with the respect and confidentiality they deserve.

### What does "anonymous" really mean?

When you post a prayer anonymously, your name is completely hidden from other users. You can add a display name like "A Friend" or stay completely anonymous. Other users won't know who posted it. We keep internal records for safety purposes only (to prevent abuse), but your identity stays private to the community.

### Can I delete a prayer after I post it?

Yes! You can delete your prayers anytime through your account. If you posted anonymously and didn't create an account, contact us and we'll help you remove it.

### What if someone posts something inappropriate?

We use AI to help catch spam and inappropriate content quickly, and our moderation team reviews flagged content. If you see something concerning, you can report it and we'll address it promptly. We're committed to keeping PrayerCircle a respectful, safe space.

### Who can see my prayers?

You decide! When you submit a prayer, you choose from three visibility options:

- **Entire PrayerCircle Community**: Everyone on the platform can see and pray for you
- **My Church Only**: Only verified members of your church can see it
- **My Church + Nearby Churches**: Churches in your area can see and support you

You can change this setting anytime.

## Using PrayerCircle

### How do I submit a prayer request?

Click "Submit a Prayer" in the navigation. Fill in your prayer title and details, choose your visibility preference, and decide whether to post with your name or anonymously. That's it!

### Can I update my prayer later?

Yes, you can edit your prayer requests or mark them as "answered" when God responds. You can also add updates to let people know how things are going.

### How do I respond to someone's prayer?

Click on any prayer to see the full details, then use the response box to share encouragement, let them know you're praying, or offer support. Your responses help people know they're not alone.

### What are prayer categories?

Our AI automatically suggests categories for prayers (like Health, Family, Financial, Spiritual Growth) to help people find relevant requests. You can filter prayers by category to focus on specific areas where you feel called to pray.

### How does the search work?

Our smart search understands natural language. Instead of searching for exact words, you can type things like "struggling with anxiety" and find prayers about worry, fear, stress, and related topics. It's designed to help you find where you can make a difference.

## Churches

### How can my church join PrayerCircle?

Click "Register Your Church" and fill out the application with your church information. Our team reviews each application to verify legitimacy (usually within 24-48 hours), then you'll be approved to join the network.

### Why do churches need to be approved?

We verify churches to protect the community and ensure PrayerCircle remains a trusted space. This helps prevent spam, fake organizations, and misuse of the platform.

### What can church administrators do?

Church admins can view prayers associated with their church, see AI-generated insights about community prayer patterns (without seeing individual details), manage church members, and create prayer groups for ministries.

### Can I join multiple churches?

Yes! If you attend multiple congregations or want to support several churches, you can join as many as you'd like.

### What are prayer groups?

Prayer groups are smaller communities within a church for specific ministries (youth group, women's ministry, missions team, etc.). They let you focus prayer support on specific areas of church life.

## AI Features

### How is AI used on PrayerCircle?

We use AI in four helpful ways:

1. **Content Safety**: AI helps us quickly identify spam or inappropriate content
2. **Categories**: AI suggests relevant categories for prayers to help with organization
3. **Smart Search**: AI helps you find prayers using natural language
4. **Church Insights**: AI creates general summaries for church leaders about community prayer patterns

### Does AI read my prayers?

AI processes prayers to categorize them and ensure safety, but it's not "reading" in the human sense. Think of it like a helpful assistant that sorts mail. Real people only review prayers if they're flagged for potential issues.

### Do you use my prayers to train AI?

No. We don't use your prayers to train commercial AI products or share them with AI companies for their purposes. The AI is here to serve you, not to collect data.

### Can I opt out of AI features?

The safety moderation is automatic to protect everyone, but you're not required to use categories or smart search. You can browse and search prayers the traditional way if you prefer.

## Email & Notifications

### What emails will I receive?

You control this! You can choose to receive:

- Notifications when someone responds to your prayers
- Weekly prayer digests from your church
- Daily prayer reminders
- Updates from churches you follow

Manage your preferences in your account settings anytime.

### How do I stop receiving emails?

Go to your account settings and adjust your email preferences, or click "unsubscribe" at the bottom of any email we send you.

## Technical Questions

### What devices can I use?

PrayerCircle works on any device with a web browser: computers, tablets, and smartphones. The design automatically adapts to your screen size.

### Do you have a mobile app?

Not yet, but our website is mobile-friendly and works great on phones. You can add it to your home screen for quick access.

### I'm having technical issues. What should I do?

- Don't share others' personal information without permission
- Don't use the platform to promote hate, violence, or illegal activities
- Be kind and supportive in your responses

### What happens if I violate the guidelines?

First-time issues usually result in a warning and content removal. Repeated or serious violations may result in account suspension. We're here to build a caring community, and we trust you'll help us maintain that.

## Account Management

### How do I change my email or password?

Go to your account settings to update your email address. If you signed in with Google or another provider, you'll manage your password through that service.

### Can I change my username?

Yes, you can update your display name in your account settings anytime.

### How do I delete my account?

Contact us at wpmcircle@gmail.com and we'll process your account deletion request. We'll remove your personal information, though some prayers may remain visible if they were posted to help others (with your name removed).

### I forgot my password. What do I do?

Click "Forgot Password" on the sign-in page and follow the instructions. We'll send you a reset link via email.

## For Church Leaders

### How do church insights work?

Church insights use AI to analyze prayer patterns in your congregation and provide general summaries like "your community is focused on health and family this month" or "financial concerns are increasing." These insights never reveal individual prayers or personal details. They're designed to help you understand where your congregation needs support.

### Can I export prayer data for my church?

Church administrators can view and export general statistics and insights, but individual prayer content is protected by privacy settings. You can see prayers that members have chosen to share with your church.

### How do I add other leaders from my church?

Contact us and we can help you add additional administrators for your church account.
