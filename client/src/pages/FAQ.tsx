      questions: [
        {
          q: "What is PrayerCircle?",
          a: "PrayerCircle is a platform that connects people who need prayer with people who want to pray. Think of it as a safe space where you can share what's on your heart and know that real people will lift you up in prayer."
        },
        {
          q: "Do I need an account to use PrayerCircle?",
          a: "You can browse prayers and see churches without an account, but you'll need to sign up to submit prayers, respond to requests, or join a church community. You can also submit prayers anonymously even without signing in."
        },
        {
          q: "Is PrayerCircle really free?",
          a: "Yes, completely free. We built this to serve the faith community, not to make money from it. There are no hidden fees, premium tiers, or paid features."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      title: "Privacy & Safety",
      questions: [
        {
          q: "Is my information safe?",
          a: "Absolutely. We use industry-standard security measures to protect your information. All data is encrypted, and we never sell your information to anyone."
        },
        {
          q: "What does 'anonymous' really mean?",
          a: "When you post a prayer anonymously, your name is completely hidden from other users. You can add a display name like 'A Friend' or stay completely anonymous. We keep internal records for safety purposes only."
        },
        {
          q: "Who can see my prayers?",
          a: "You decide! Choose from: Entire Community (everyone), My Church Only (verified members), or My Church + Nearby Churches (local area). You can change this anytime."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      title: "Using PrayerCircle",
      questions: [
        {
          q: "How do I submit a prayer request?",
          a: "Click 'Submit a Prayer' in the navigation. Fill in your prayer title and details, choose your visibility preference, and decide whether to post with your name or anonymously."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I update my prayer later?",
          a: "Yes, you can edit your prayer requests or mark them as 'answered' when God responds. You can also add updates to let people know how things are going."
        },
        {
          q: "How does the search work?",
          a: "Our smart search understands natural language. Type things like 'struggling with anxiety' and find prayers about worry, fear, stress, and related topics."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      title: "Churches",
      questions: [
        {
          q: "How can my church join PrayerCircle?",
          a: "Click 'Register Your Church' and fill out the application. Our team reviews each application to verify legitimacy (usually within 24-48 hours)."
        },
        {
          q: "Why do churches need to be approved?",
          a: "We verify churches to protect the community and ensure PrayerCircle remains a trusted space. This helps prevent spam and fake organizations."
        },
        {
          q: "What can church administrators do?",
          a: "Church admins can view prayers associated with their church, see AI-generated insights about community prayer patterns, manage church members, and create prayer groups for ministries."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      title: "AI Features",
      questions: [
        {
          q: "How is AI used on PrayerCircle?",
          a: "We use AI for: Content Safety (identifying spam), Categories (organizing prayers), Smart Search (natural language), and Church Insights (general summaries for leaders)."
        },
        {
          q: "Does AI read my prayers?",
          a: "AI processes prayers to categorize them and ensure safety, but it's not 'reading' in the human sense. Think of it like a helpful assistant that sorts mail."
        },
        {
          q: "Do you use my prayers to train AI?",
          a: "No. We don't use your prayers to train commercial AI products or share them with AI companies. The AI is here to serve you."
