# Privacy Policy for PrayerCircle

**Last Updated:** [Insert Date]

## Our Commitment to You

At PrayerCircle, we understand that prayer is deeply personal. Your trust means everything to us, and we're committed to protecting your privacy while helping you connect with a caring community. This policy explains how we handle your information in simple, straightforward terms.

## The Simple Version

Here's what you need to know:

- **Your prayers are yours.** You control who sees them through visibility settings.
- **We don't sell your information.** Ever. That's not what we're about.
- **Anonymous is truly anonymous.** When you post anonymously, your name stays hidden.
- **We keep things safe.** We use AI to help prevent spam and inappropriate content, but real people make the final calls.
- **You're in control.** You can update, delete, or export your information anytime.

## What Information We Collect

### When You Create an Account

We collect basic information like your name and email address when you sign up. If you use Google or another service to sign in, we receive your basic profile information from them.

### When You Share a Prayer Request

We save your prayer title, content, and any church you associate it with. If you choose to post anonymously, we keep your identity private from other users. You decide who can see each prayer through our visibility options.

### When You Join a Church Community

We keep track of which churches you're connected to so you can see prayers from your congregation and receive relevant updates.

### Automatic Information

Like most websites, we collect basic information about how you use PrayerCircle (pages you visit, features you use) to help us improve the experience. We also use cookies to keep you logged in and remember your preferences.

## How We Use Your Information

### To Connect You with Prayer Support

We use your information to show you relevant prayers, connect you with church communities, and notify you when people respond to your prayer requests.

### To Keep the Community Safe

We use AI tools to help identify spam or inappropriate content, but real people always make the final decision about what stays or goes. This helps keep PrayerCircle a safe, respectful space for everyone.

### To Make Things Better

We look at how people use PrayerCircle to understand what's working and what we can improve. This helps us build features that actually serve your needs.

### To Help Churches Serve Better

For church administrators, we provide insights about prayer patterns in their community (like "many people are praying about health concerns this month"). These insights never reveal individual prayers or personal details.

## Who Can See Your Information

### Your Prayer Visibility Choices

You control who sees each prayer request:

- **Entire Community**: Everyone on PrayerCircle can see and pray for you
- **My Church Only**: Only verified members of your church can see it
- **My Church + Nearby Churches**: Churches in your area can see and support you

### Anonymous Prayers

When you post anonymously, other users won't see your name. You can add a display name like "A Friend" or stay completely anonymous. We keep internal records for safety reasons, but your identity stays private to the community.

### Church Administrators

Church administrators can see prayers associated with their church (based on your visibility settings) to help them provide pastoral care and support.

### Service Providers

We work with trusted companies that help us run PrayerCircle, like our hosting provider and email service. They're required to keep your information confidential and only use it to help us serve you.

## Your Privacy Rights

You have complete control over your information:

- **View Your Data**: See all your prayers, church memberships, and account information anytime
- **Update Information**: Change your details, email preferences, or church connections whenever you want
- **Delete Your Account**: Request account deletion and we'll remove your information
- **Control Visibility**: Change who can see your prayers at any time
- **Manage Emails**: Choose which notifications you receive
- **Export Your Data**: Get a copy of your information if you need it

To exercise any of these rights, just reach out to us at wpmcircle@gmail.com or use your account settings.

## How We Protect Your Information

We take security seriously:

- All data is encrypted when it travels between your device and our servers
- We use secure authentication methods
- Access to sensitive information is restricted to authorized personnel only
- We regularly review and update our security practices

While we do everything we can to protect your information, no online service is 100% secure. We're committed to being transparent and responsive if any security issues arise.

## AI and How We Use It

We use AI to enhance your experience in helpful ways:

**Content Safety**: AI helps us quickly identify potential spam or inappropriate content. Think of it as a helpful assistant that flags things for human review.

**Prayer Categories**: AI suggests categories for prayers (like Health, Family, or Spiritual Growth) to help people find relevant requests. You're not required to use these categories.

**Smart Search**: AI helps you find prayers using natural language, so you can search for "struggling with anxiety" and find related prayers about worry, fear, and stress.

**Church Insights**: For church leaders, AI creates general summaries like "your community is focused on health and family this month" without revealing individual prayers.

We don't use your prayers to train commercial AI products. The AI is here to serve you, not the other way around.

## For Parents

PrayerCircle is designed for adults and teens with parental guidance. We don't knowingly collect information from children under 13. If you believe a child has created an account, please let us know and we'll remove it.

## Changes to This Policy

If we make changes to how we handle your information, we'll update this page and let you know. We'll always give you a heads-up about significant changes.

## Questions or Concerns?

We're here to help. If you have questions about privacy, want to exercise your rights, or just want to chat about how we protect your information, reach out:

**Email**: wpmcircle@gmail.com  
**Support Hours**: Monday - Friday, 9am - 5pm EST

We typically respond within 24-48 hours.

## A Note About Location

PrayerCircle is operated in the United States. If you're using our service from another country, your information will be stored on servers in the US. By using PrayerCircle, you're okay with this.

## Legal Stuff (Required Language)

**California Residents**: You have the right to know what information we collect, request deletion, and opt-out of any sale of information (though we don't sell information anyway).

**European Users**: You have additional rights under GDPR, including the right to access, correct, delete, or export your data. Contact us to exercise these rights.

**Legal Requests**: We may need to share information if required by law or to protect safety, but we'll always do our best to protect your privacy within legal bounds.

---

**Bottom Line**: We built PrayerCircle to help people pray for each other, not to collect data. Your privacy matters to us because your prayers matter to us.

By using PrayerCircle, you're agreeing to this Privacy Policy. If something doesn't feel right or you have questions, please reach out. We're real people who care about this community.
